# SENG201 Template Project Overview
Welcome to the template project for SENG201 which you will transform into your own.
This README file includes some useful information to help you get started.
However, we expect that this README becomes your own

## Notes
Remember you are required to commit your code to the **main** branch of your repository before the deadline.

This project contains default naming of `team0` throughout.
If you are interested you can update this to reflect your team number, however it is **not required**.
This can be done by renaming any instance of `team0` with `team<x>` (where x is your number).
IntelliJ can help with this using `ctrl+shift+f` to find all instances of a string, and `ctrl+shift+r` to replace them, though make sure to change the package names as well.

## Importing Project (Using IntelliJ)
IntelliJ has built-in support for Gradle. To import your project:

- Launch IntelliJ and choose `Open` from the start-up window.
- Select the project and click open
- At this point in the bottom right notifications you may be prompted to 'load gradle scripts', If so, click load

**Note:** *If you run into dependency issues when running the app or the Gradle pop up doesn't appear then open the Gradle sidebar and click the Refresh icon.*

## Run Project 
1. Open a command line interface inside the project directory and run `./gradlew run` to run the app.
2. The app should then open a new window, this may not be displayed over IntelliJ but can be easily selected from the taskbar

## Build and Run Jar
1. Open a command line interface inside the project directory and run `./gradlew jar` to create a packaged Jar. The Jar file is located at build/libs/seng201_team0-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
2. Navigate to the build/libs/ directory (you can do this with `cd build/libs`)
3. Run the command `java -jar seng201_team0-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` to open the application.

## Run Tests
1. Open a command line interface inside the project directory and run `./gradlew test` to run the tests.
2. Test results should be printed to the command line

**Note:** *This Jar is **NOT** cross-platform, so you **must** build the jar you submit on Linux.*
